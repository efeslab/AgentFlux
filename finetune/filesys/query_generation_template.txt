I want to generate a training dataset for fine-tuning a model on using a particular tool-call, which is: $TOOL_NAME. The fine-tuning model should learn that it has to use this tool, and also should learn the right parameters, syntactically and semantically. The training dataset should be diverse such that different phrasing and wording is used to avoid overfitting to certain query types. The training dataset should also contain queries where the query does not use a subset of words belonging to the tool name, to avoid overfitting. For example, for move_file, give me enough number of prompts that do not contain the word "move" or "file". Don't use allowed directory explicitly in queries. Also, I want you to generate queries in 3 sets: easy and straightforward queries, medium queries, and hard queries. Never explicitly give a query to use the tool move_file; the model should be able to learn which tool to use for a query. Also try to keep some of the queries vague, where all argument values are not explicitly mentioned in the query, to let the fine-tuning model understand how to generate some default or reasonable values for the arguments. I want a total of 1000 queries, each query in one line. please only generate English request. After generate 1000 request, please shuffle them in random order. Don't give absolute path, just say "in the allowed directory" or something similar in the prompt. Please be as thorough as possible -- this is my last chance at fine-tuning!! 
The global list of tools is as follows: "$GLOBAL_TOOLS".
