Purpose: Convert FIFTY detailed tasks into natural, conversational FIFTY user requests. Each request takes only one line.
Convert these detailed tasks into NATURAL, CONVERSATIONAL USER REQUESTS that truly test the agent's reasoning ability.
Original detailed tasks:
$DETAILED_TASKS
CRITICAL: CREATE FIFTY GENUINELY NATURAL REQUESTS
ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
• ANY structured language that looks like a task description
• Phrases like "I need to analyze", "I want to compare", "Please evaluate"
• ANY specific server/platform names (arXiv, PubMed, Yahoo Finance, Google Maps, etc.)
• ANY tool names or technical implementation details
• Lists, enumerations, or step-by-step instructions
• Formal task language ("perform", "conduct", "execute", "implement")
INSTEAD, CREATE FIFTY NATURAL CONVERSATIONS:
• Start with context or a problem the user is facing
• Use conversational openers: "I'm trying to figure out...", "Been wondering about...", "Got a
situation here..."
• Include uncertainty: "not sure if ", "maybe", "possibly", "might be"
• Add personal context: "for my project", "my boss asked", "I'm curious about"
• Express the need through a story or scenario, not a task list
HIDE THE TASK STRUCTURES COMPLETELY:
Don't say: "I need to analyze financial metrics for AAPL, GOOGL, and MSFT"
Say instead: "I've been thinking about rebalancing my portfolio and I'm curious how tech
giants like AAPL, GOOGL, and MSFT have been doing lately. Which one would you say looks
strongest right now?"
Don't say: "Search for recent papers on CRISPR and summarize the key findings"
Say instead: "I'm giving a presentation next week about gene editing. What's the latest buzz
around CRISPR? Any breakthrough discoveries I should know about?"
Don't say: "Calculate the thermal efficiency and optimize the heat exchanger parameters"
Say instead: "We've got this heat exchanger running at 80°C inlet, 60°C outlet with 0.5 kg/s
flow. It doesn't seem very efficient to me. Can you help me figure out what's going on and
maybe how to improve it?"
PRESERVE CRITICAL DATA NATURALLY:
• Embed specific values conversationally: "around 150 or so", "somewhere near San Francisco"
• Use approximate language when appropriate: "roughly", "about", "somewhere between"
• Keep exact values only when truly necessary (calculations, IDs, etc.)
{calculation_requirements}
MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A REAL PERSON:
• Use contractions: "I'm", "don't", "can't", "what's"
• Include filler words sparingly: "actually", "basically", "you know"
• Show emotion or urgency when appropriate: "really need to know", "been bugging me"
• Ask questions naturally: "What do you think?", "Does that make sense?", "Am I overthinking
this?"
EXAMPLES OF NATURAL FUZZY DESCRIPTIONS:
Example 1 (Finance):
"So I've been watching my tech stocks lately and honestly, I'm not sure if I should hold or sell.
AAPL, GOOGL, and MSFT make up most of my portfolio. With everything going on in the
market, which one do you think has the best outlook? I'm particularly worried about their debt
levels and cash flow situation. Need some real data to back up any decision here, not just gut
feelings."
Example 2 (Research):
"I'm preparing for a journal club presentation and everyone's been talking about these new
CRISPR developments. What's actually new in the past few months? I keep hearing about
off-target effects being solved but can't find solid evidence. Would really appreciate concrete
findings from recent studies, not just hype."
Example 3 (Technical):
"We're having issues with our heat exchanger setup - running at 80°C in, 60°C out, flow rate's
about 0.5 kg/s. My manager thinks we're wasting energy but I need to prove it with actual
numbers. Can you work out what our current efficiency is and maybe suggest what parameters
we should tweak? Need solid calculations to convince them to approve changes."
CRITICAL: End naturally with evidence requirements woven into the conversation:
Instead of: "Please provide evidence-based analysis with concrete data"
Say: "I really need actual data on this - can't go to my boss with just opinions. Whatever you
find, make sure it's backed up by real numbers or solid sources, okay?"
ALWAYS USE relative dates/times (e.g., "next 7 days", "past 3 months", "upcoming week" not
"January 2024" or "2024-01-15")
Return ONLY the natural, conversational fuzzy description - make it sound like a real person
asking for help, not a robot executing a task.
