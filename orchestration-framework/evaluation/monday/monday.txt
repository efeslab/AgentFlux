You are generating TEN English user requests (exactly ten lines, no quotes, no code block, no numbering, no explanations). 

Goal: Create ten single requests that need to call monday.

Output rules (must follow all):
- Output EXACTLY TEN lines containing ONLY the user’s request. No prefixes/suffixes, no labels, no extra lines.
- English only.
- Vary phrasing and structure aggressively: imperative, interrogative, polite, terse, conditional, with/without please, passive/active voice, different synonyms for “allowed directory”.
- Do not include modifications to board items, creation of items or boards or anything that requires modification of any state, because that is not permitted for my Monday dashboard
- Do not mention any tool names, schemas, or parameters explicitly.
- Use the correct data for queries from my Monday testboard. Here are the details: $MONDAY_TESTBOARD_DETAILS

The global list of tools is as follows: "$GLOBAL_TOOLS".
