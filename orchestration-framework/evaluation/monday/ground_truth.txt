The team agreed on key integration points (payment flow, webhooks, reconciliation) and identified owners and open questions to resolve before development.\n\nKey Points\n\n- Attendees: [Add attendee names]\n- Primary goals: accept online payments, support refunds/disputes, enable subscriptions (if needed)\n- Supported payment methods: cards (Visa, Mastercard), wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay), local methods (SEPA, ACH) as required\n- Integration approach: Payment Intents API for SCA compliance; consider Stripe Checkout or Elements to reduce PCI scope\n- Webhooks: handle payment_intent.succeeded, charge.refunded, dispute.created; plan idempotency and retry logic\n- Customer model: create Stripe Customer objects for saved payment methods; store Stripe IDs for reconciliation\n- Reconciliation & reporting: map Stripe transactions to billing/accounting system; use metadata for internal IDs\n- Security & compliance: PCI scope reduction, SCA, least-privilege API keys, and data residency considerations\n- Error handling & monitoring: idempotency keys, retries, alerts for failed payments or webhook failures\n- Timelines: discovery -> design -> development -> testing -> staging validation -> production launch (add dates)\n- Open questions: expected monthly volume, required currencies, refund policy and SLA, authentication approach for backend\n\nNext Steps\n\n- Assign owners for API integration, webhook handling, and QA/testing\n- Draft technical design document with payment flows and security controls\n- Schedule a follow-up meeting to confirm timelines\n- Confirm transaction volumes and required currencies\n\nNotes / Action Items\n\n- Meeting date/time: [Add date/time]\n- Action: [Owner] to draft technical design by [date]\n- Action: [Owner] to create Stripe test accounts and API keys\n\nNotes about doc attachment\n\nI attempted to create a \"doc\" column on board 9603347583 to attach a document to this item, but the integration lacks permission to add columns on that board. If you want a separate monday Doc with a shareable link attached to the item, either:\n- Grant the integration permission to create columns, or\n- Manually add a \"doc\" column (recommended title: \"Docs\" or \"Notes\") to board 9603347583 and I will attach the doc, or\n- I can create a workspace document and paste the shareable link here if you prefer (I can try again).\n\nFor now, these notes are attached to the item as an update.", "created_at": "2025-08-19T06:25:09.000Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-19T06:25:09.000Z", "creator": {"id": "78498998", "name": "Hossein K", "email": "hkhk.sharif@gmail.com"}, "replies": []}, {"id": "4412835626", "body": "We need to prepare a demo environment.", "text_body": "We need to prepare a demo environment.", "created_at": "2025-08-19T03:33:44.000Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-19T03:33:44.000Z", "creator": {"id": "78498998", "name": "Hossein K", "email": "hkhk.sharif@gmail.com"}, "replies": []}, {"id": "4412835537", "body": "Waiting on legal to review the contract.", "text_body": "Waiting on legal to review the contract.", "created_at": "2025-08-19T03:33:37.000Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-19T03:33:37.000Z", "creator": {"id": "78498998", "name": "Hossein K", "email": "hkhk.sharif@gmail.com"}, "replies": []}, {"id": "4412835469", "body": "Client is OOO; shift timeline by a week.", "text_body": "Client is OOO; shift timeline by a week.", "created_at": "2025-08-19T03:33:31.000Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-19T03:33:31.000Z", "creator": {"id": "78498998", "name": "Hossein K", "email": "hkhk.sharif@gmail.com"}, "replies": []}, {"id": "4412605718", "body": "@team \u2014 Summary of current blockers:<br><br>\u2022 External integration: waiting on API credentials and access from the partner; prevents end-to-end testing.
